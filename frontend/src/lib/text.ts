export const content :string = `Hey there, I'm Muneer Currently in my fourth year of computer science engineering. I am full stack web developer who loves to just build and break solution for my sheer egoism. I have created multiple projects in using diffrent technologies like NextJS React Hono Cloudflare Workers and many more. 

Coming to this assignment, as required i created a react application with a a static page (this one) and had to dynamically generate OG image for the post page. To generate the dynamically the og image I choosed to generate it on server written using express and typscript. On the server I used the node-canvas library to create aesthetic graphical open graph. To add Meta tag on the react component i used react-helmet to add the meta tags for the og image. I also used tailwind css for styling the react component.


I have been really inspired by medial's journey and would love to be a part of such a dedicated team. I am really looking forward to work with you guys.`
